# `Try`, `catch` and `finally`

## Objective

In this challenge, we learn about strings and exceptions. Check out the attached tutorials for more details.

## Task

1. Complete the `reverseString` function; it has one parameter, `s`. You must perform the following actions:
2. Try to reverse string `s` using the split, reverse, and join methods.
If an exception is thrown, catch it and print the contents of the exception's `message` on a new line.
1. Print `s` on a new line. If no exception was thrown, then this should be the reversed string; if an exception was thrown, this should be the original string.
